# Provenance of the local AI provider icons

[简体中文](ai-provider-assets.zh-CN.md)

The hand-off destinations are an HTTPS allow-list fixed in code (no user input,
query or fragment is accepted): `https://chatgpt.com/`, `https://claude.ai/`,
`https://gemini.google.com/app`, `https://www.kimi.com/`,
`https://www.doubao.com/chat/`, `https://chat.deepseek.com/`,
`https://grok.com/`. Tauri Opener permits only those seven addresses; the icons
are bundled with the app at build time and are never hot-linked from a
third-party CDN at runtime.

Every asset below comes from the corresponding AI product site's own
favicon/app-icon resource — not the parent company's corporate logo. Retrieved
2026-08-15 (Asia/Shanghai). The PNG/WebP bytes are pinned by SHA-256, and the
verification script is `scripts/assets/verify-ai-assets.py`.

The accessible initial-letter fallback appears in the AI picker only when an
icon fails to load; the normal path always renders the seven local product icons
above. Device cards fall back to an original outline drawn in code when the
product WebP fails to load, rather than letting wrapped `alt` text pose as an
image.
